# Changelog

Two version numbers, and they are not the same thing. The repo carries a semver tag for humans. Each
**file** separately carries a LibStub **MINOR** integer that increments on every released change to
that file — that is what LibStub compares when it picks a winner between vendored copies, and a
released change that forgets its bump silently does not reach any host that already has the old copy.

Every release therefore opens with a version block naming each file's live minor.
`tests/test_versioning.lua` enforces that the block and every major's `lib.MODULES` agree, so the two
cannot drift. Release order is in
[docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md).

## Unreleased

Versions in this release: **Core minor 2**, **DebugLog minor 3**, **Slash minor 4**,
**Options minor 3**, **OptionsWidgets minor 3**, **OptionsScroll minor 2**,
**Perf minor 5**, **PerfPanel minor 3**.

Grouped by major, newest first. A file's entries live under the major that owns it, so "what changed
in Perf" is one heading rather than a hunt.

### The page registry grew a renderer seam, a guard and a second tier — `Options.lua`

Three regressions a host could not work around, all of which ConsumableMaster's adoption declined
the whole registry over.

**One raising page builder no longer costs every page after it.** `CreateOptionsPanel` ran the
builders in a bare loop, so a single failure left a half-registered options tree with nothing
naming which page did it. Each builder is pcall'd separately now and reports its key; `O.__pages()`
is what actually built. A page registered *after* the build is built immediately rather than queued
behind a drain that has already happened — queued, it silently never appeared.

**A panel opened during combat refuses.** `O.SetRenderer(ctx, fn)` declares how a page draws
itself, and the library owns *when*: first show, and again after a refresh marked it dirty while it
was hidden. It also builds the Defaults button there (the AceGUI skinning reason, unchanged) and
closes the Settings window with the canonical grey notice under lockdown. That last one matters
because the Blizzard AddOns sidebar reaches a panel **without** going through `OpenOptionsPanel` —
so the one guard that existed was bypassed on exactly the path a user is most likely to take
mid-fight. A raising renderer is reported rather than propagated: inside AceGUI's own dispatch it
would take the click handling of every widget on the frame with it.

**Refreshing is two things, and they now have two names.** `RefreshAllPanels` is STRUCTURAL — it
re-runs the page's renderer, so rows that appeared or disappeared are drawn. `RefreshScalars` is IN
PLACE — refreshers only, no rebuild — and it is what every widget maker's own `set()` calls, since
writing a value does not change which rows exist. A page that is not on screen is flagged dirty and
re-renders on its next show instead of being rebuilt fifteen times per keystroke.

`RefreshAllPanels` keeps its name and gains the renderer, which is the one thing here that changes
meaning for an existing host. The migration is opt-in and costs nothing: a ctx that never went
through `SetRenderer` has no renderer to re-run, so both tiers fall back to running its refreshers
ungated, exactly as before. A host adopts the registry one page at a time, or never.

### Alpha, tooltips and live sliders — `OptionsWidgets.lua`

`hasAlpha` defaults to **true** now. This is a flipped default, and the only one in this release.
The old `row.hasAlpha and true or false` made a declared `false` indistinguishable from an absent
field, so no host could express "no alpha" even deliberately — while the colour codec beside it
models alpha as a first-class component of every colour it stores (`a or 1` on write, `c.a or 1` on
read). Suppressing the slider by default contradicted the codec: a stored alpha the user could
never reach. A host that wants the old behaviour writes `hasAlpha = false`, which it can say for
the first time.

The old default was entirely uncovered — the only assertion read a fixture row that declared
`hasAlpha = true`, so nothing anywhere pinned the false. The fixture now carries a row declaring
neither (that is the one proving the default) and a second declaring `false`, because a default
nothing asserts is a default nothing protects.

A tooltip body reads `row.tooltip` first and falls back to `row.desc`. Every Ka0s host's schema
declares `tooltip`; this library invented `desc`. Reading only `desc` therefore blanked the body on
every widget of any host on the standard's own shape — the label still renders, so it fails
silently and only in game. Both names are accepted; nothing has to move.

Sliders can commit on the drag. `sliderCommit = "change"` on the descriptor, or `commitOn` on a
single row, adds a throttled `OnValueChanged` write alongside the `OnMouseUp` one; the default
stays release-only and an unchanged host is untouched. It exists because a page whose number rows
drive something visible while dragging — a bar's width, a button's scale — has no preview without
it, and there was no hook to ask for one. The drag reuses the colour picker's re-armed single timer
rather than the per-frame write a host would write by hand: a 60 Hz drag otherwise fans a refresh
pass out across every registered panel sixty times a second. Live commits snap to the row's step
exactly as the release commit does, or the release would silently correct what the drag stored.

`SetIsPercent` reads `row.isPercent` instead of being hardcoded false, which is the whole reason
that field exists in the schema.

### Colours: the positional shape renders, and hosts get a codec — `Slash.lua`

`lib.FormatValue` reads both stored colour shapes now. The named keys win when present, so a host
storing `{ r =, g =, b =, a = }` renders exactly as before; a host storing `{ r, g, b, a }`
POSITIONALLY used to render every colour as `{0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 1.00}`.

That is the shape the Ka0s options colour widget itself writes — this library's own
`OptionsWidgets.lua` documents the divergence and takes a codec for it, while `Slash.lua` had no
hook at all: `kv()` called the lib-level formatter directly, so a host could not even override it.
Two majors, one collection, opposite assumptions about the same stored value. It shipped green
because nothing outside the Slash suite asserts a rendered colour's VALUE.

`colorDecode` / `colorEncode` join the Slash descriptor under the same names the Options descriptor
already uses, so a host passes one pair to both majors. `CliSet` encodes into the host's shape
before writing, and both echo sites — `CliSet`'s and `CliReset`'s — read back through it.

### Enum rows: the ordered-array shape is read now — `Slash.lua`, `OptionsWidgets.lua`

Both enum readers accept the Ka0s options schema's own shape — an **ordered array** of
`{ value =, text = }` — alongside AceGUI's key map. The array's position is its order, so a row
declared `{ {value="RIGHT"}, {value="LEFT"} }` offers Right then Left in the dropdown and lists
`RIGHT, LEFT` in the CLI's allowed values.

It has never worked. `allowedValues` iterated `pairs(row.values)` and returned the sorted
`tostring`'d KEYS, and the dropdown handed the raw table to `SetList` — so a standard-shaped row
offered `1, 2` as its allowed values and mapped index to table. Every Ka0s addon declares enums
this way, which is why the options row makers and the schema CLI were both declined during
ConsumableMaster's adoption: one defect, two majors, ~250 lines that could not move.

`enumList` is duplicated **verbatim** in both files rather than hoisted into `Core.lua`. Hoisting
would raise `NEEDS_CORE` in two majors, which `docs/releasing.md` calls a breaking change to the
vendoring — every consumer carrying a stale `Core.lua` would lose both majors outright. The two
copies must agree or the CLI accepts a value the dropdown cannot display, so a cross-major parity
case renders each fixture enum and asserts the CLI accepts every option the dropdown offers, in
both shapes. That is the guarantee the duplication buys.

Three shapes were actually in play, not two. `{ SHORT = true }` — a key *set* — is what both
fixtures and several host rows declare, and its labels rendered as the literal string `"true"` in a
real client. Nothing caught it because the AceGUI mock records the list without reading its text.
A set now labels each entry with its key, which is the only honest label it has.

Two behaviour changes fall out, both deliberate:

- A `type = "number"` row **carrying a values list** now rejects an out-of-list value instead of
  clamping it. Clamping lands between two entries, and the renderer then has no label for what is
  stored — the row reads blank and the user cannot tell what they set. A number row *without* a
  list clamps exactly as before.
- A `type = "string"` row **without** a values list now accepts free text. The old reader walked an
  empty allowed-list and therefore refused every value, so `dialogControl = "EditBox"` rows shipped
  un-settable from the CLI.

### `interface` was always 0 — `Perf.lua`

A record's `interface` field is read from `GetBuildInfo()`'s fourth return now, not from
`GetAddOnMetadata(name, "Interface")`.

Blizzard does not serve `Interface` through the addon-metadata API — it serves `Title`, `Notes`,
`Author`, `Version` and `X-*` — so the old lookup answered nil and **every record ever emitted
stamped `"interface":0`**, making an archived capture unattributable to a game build. Confirmed
against a live 12.0.7 client: `C_AddOns.GetAddOnMetadata("KickCD", "Interface")` returns nothing.

This repo had a case pinning the field at `120007`, and it passed throughout — because
`tests/wow_mock.lua` stubbed `GetAddOnMetadata` to return `"120007"` for **any field asked of it**.
A stub that silently succeeds is worse than no stub (kit fidelity rule 1), and this is what that
rule costs when it is broken: the one case written to catch this exact failure could only ever pass.
The mock now answers only the fields Blizzard actually serves, and supplies `GetBuildInfo`.

The semantics shift slightly and for the better: the field is the **client's** interface version
rather than the host's TOC line. For a current addon they agree; when they disagree the client's is
the one that explains the capture.

### The `L` trap — `DebugLog.lua`, `Slash.lua`, `Perf.lua`

An `L` override is now resolved with `rawget` rather than a plain index, in all three modules that
take one.

Every Ka0s host's locale table carries a metatable fallback that answers an unknown key **with the
key** — the standard mandates it (anti-patterns #2). A plain index therefore accepted that
synthesised string for *every* key, so a host that passed its addon-wide locale table made these
modules' own `STRINGS` unreachable and rendered raw keys in place of English. It fails for every
string at once, cannot fail in a headless case that only checks a label is non-empty, and is visible
only in game.

It shipped: KickCD's perf panel rendered `Ka0s KickCDPANEL_TITLE_SUFFIX` and seven `STEP_*` keys.
AbsorbTracker was unaffected because it passes no `L` at all.

`rawget` asks the only question that matters — did the host actually put a value here? A genuine
entry still overrides; a fallback-only table correctly falls through. **Additive and
behaviour-preserving for every existing consumer**: a real entry is `rawget`-visible, so no host that
was working changes.

`PerfPanel.lua` does NOT bump: it receives `tr` as a parameter from `Perf.lua`, so the fix reaches
the step panel without the file changing.

The README's per-module descriptor tables previously said *"hosts on the Ka0s standard pass their
`NS.L`"*, which was precisely the advice that caused this. Corrected, and a **The `L` trap** section
added to the README and to `docs/adoption-prompt.md` with the one-line assertion that catches it:
a rendered label must not match `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]+$`.

### Review fixes — all five majors

Found by the `/wow-addon:review` gate on this branch and fixed before it merged. Every file's
minor moves, because every file changed: the en-US sweep below is comment-only but touches all
eight, and whole-folder re-vendoring is mandatory anyway.

- **`Options.lua`** — `EnsureDefaultsButton` reached `O.AttachTooltip` without the guard its own
  closing comment claimed, so a vendored copy missing `OptionsWidgets.lua` raised from the
  library's shell on the first panel `OnShow` rather than degrading. Guarded, like the sibling
  reach into `PatchAlwaysShowScrollbar` already was.
- **`Options.lua`** — the default `print` was a silent no-op alone among the five majors, so a
  host that omitted it got a combat refusal and a missing-AceGUI notice that vanished with nothing
  to grep for. It now falls back to `DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME`, matching Core, DebugLog and Slash. The
  library still cannot supply the host's tag, so the descriptor's `print` remains the intended path.
- **`Options.lua`** — `:New` now raises on a missing `mainPanelName`. It is the one field whose
  entire purpose is lost silently: a nil yields an anonymous canvas that `/framestack` cannot
  attribute, with nothing visible in game. The other fields' documented no-validation gap stands.
- **`Options.lua`** — `CreateOptionsPanel` is idempotent. A second call registered a duplicate
  Blizzard category and appended a second ctx per page, permanently doubling the `RefreshAllPanels`
  fan-out.
- **`OptionsWidgets.lua`** — `RenderRows` implemented both one-shot hooks by writing `nil` into
  the tables the CALLER owns, so a host that hoisted its `afterGroup`/`pairWith` to a file-level
  constant silently lost every inline button and paired widget on the second render — which a
  per-unit page does on every unit switch. The bookkeeping is now the library's. One-shot semantics
  per call are unchanged.
- **`Slash.lua`** — `FormatValue` fed three of its branches to `string.format` unguarded, and a
  WoW secret raises there exactly as it does in `table.concat`. The invariant that made this safe
  — a stored settings value is never a combat-protected one — was real but written down nowhere
  and enforced nowhere. Guarded at the input, so every ordinary rendered value is byte-identical.
- **`DebugLog.lua`** — `lib.MakeCloseButton` snapshotted Core's function VALUE at file load.
  LibStub upgrades a major in place, so a newer `Core.lua` over an unchanged `DebugLog.lua` left
  the console drawing the old button while `MODULES.Core` truthfully reported the new minor. Now a
  forwarder through the `core` table, the shape `PerfPanel.lua` already used.
- **`DebugLog.lua`** — `D:Add` did not route its message through the secret-safe stringifier,
  though the gated sink and `initSummary` both did. It is public, ungated by design, and the path a
  host's perf output takes.
- **All eight files, and `testkit/mock_base.lua`** — en-US spelling in comments, per the standard.
  Comments only; no string literal moved.

`tests/test_kitsync.lua` is new and closes the gap that let the previous commit ship a
`testkit/README.md` that was never re-vendored: `testkit/` and `tests/_kit/` are now compared
byte for byte, README included, with no line-ending normalisation, and the failure names the file.
It caught a real divergence during this very change.

### `LibKa0s-Options-1.0`

- New module `LibStub("LibKa0s-Options-1.0")` — the Blizzard settings-canvas shell, the schema-row
  to AceGUI translation and the two-column flow engine, in three files under one major
  (`Options.lua`, `OptionsWidgets.lua`, `OptionsScroll.lua`). `lib:New{ parentTitle, get, set,
  applyDefault, rowsForPage, allRows, … }` returns an instance owning its own panel registry, so
  one addon's Defaults button can never run another's refreshers. The basenames are namespaced
  because the changelog check below plain-searches one file for `<Basename> minor <N>`, and
  `Widgets.lua`/`Panel.lua` are exactly what a future window module would want.
- Five widget types ship in `-1.0`, not four: the edit box (`dialogControl = "EditBox"`) is here
  because adding a type later is additive but retrofitting one into a frozen dispatch table is not.
  No AbsorbTracker row uses it; KickCD's label rows do.
- Colour storage is a descriptor codec rather than a baked-in shape, because AbsorbTracker stores
  `{r=,g=,b=,a=}` and KickCD stores arrays, and picking a winner would force one of them to
  translate at every read site in the addon. The 50 ms colour-drag throttle likewise takes the
  host's `scheduleTimer`: embedding AceTimer would be this library's second dependency breach.
- `OpenOptionsPanel` REFUSES under combat and never defers-and-replays, and the gate lives inside
  the open rather than in a host's dispatcher, so a `/run` script is refused too.
- The always-shown scrollbar marker is `_ka0sAlwaysScrollbar`. AceGUI pools ScrollFrames across
  every addon in a session, so per-addon marker names would let two addons each patch a widget the
  other had already patched.

### `LibKa0s-Slash-1.0`

- New module `LibStub("LibKa0s-Slash-1.0")` — the slash dispatcher, the help renderer, the schema
  CLI (`list`/`get`/`set`/`reset`/`resetall`/`version`) and the type-aware value parser. The parser
  is the reason this shape won rather than the coercing one the other copies carry: a number clamps
  to its row's range instead of storing a value the panel cannot honour, a string outside its enum
  is refused with the allowed values listed, and a colour parses `r g b [a]` instead of printing a
  table address. `SetRowAnnotator` lets a host append a note at the three sites that render a
  setting — list, get and set — and at no others.
- The COMMANDS table stays the host's and is passed into the descriptor. A host renders the same
  table on its own About page, so a library owning it would force the options module to consume
  this one — and two libraries reaching for each other is a real dependency cycle.

### `LibKa0s-DebugLog-1.0`

- New module `LibStub("LibKa0s-DebugLog-1.0")` — the on-screen debug console, which was the most
  duplicated thing in the collection: seven hand-transcribed copies of a window the standard already
  specifies down to the hex codes. `lib:New{ name, title, font, isEnabled, setEnabled, … }` returns
  an instance owning its own buffer and its own frames, with every frame global derived from `name`
  so two addons cannot collide on `UISpecialFrames`. The enable flag stays the host's: the library
  reads and writes it through the `isEnabled`/`setEnabled` pair rather than keeping a second copy
  that its slash command and its settings panel would disagree with. `initSummary` makes the
  `[Init]` line a host callback, which is what five of the sister addons already do.
- The buffer cap is now covered: no addon suite ever wrote 501 lines, so the eviction path had never
  run under test.

### `LibKa0s-Core-1.0`

- New module `LibStub("LibKa0s-Core-1.0")` — the two seams every other module sits on. The
  secret-safe seam (`IsConcatSafe`, `SafeToString`, `SECRET`) carries AbsorbTracker's canonical
  `table.concat` probe, the only detector that fails on what a real combat-protected value actually
  fails on; the window chrome seam (`SKIN`, `ApplySkin`, `MakeCloseButton`) holds the backdrop and
  the close × a host's windows share. `lib:New{ prefix, sep, sink }` returns the prefixed,
  secret-safe chat printer, with `prefix` re-read on every call so a host whose tag constant loads
  later can pass a function instead of capturing nil forever.

### `LibKa0s-Perf-1.0`

- **Fixed:** a combat-protected value logged by a perf run rendered as its raw self, then raised
  inside the host's `table.concat(buffer, "\n")` when the user pressed Copy — killing the Copy
  button for the rest of the session. `Perf minor 2` deletes the private stringifier that caused it
  (it branched on `type()`, and a secret *is* a string or a number) in favour of
  `Core.SafeToString`. Perf now declares a minimum Core and refuses to register below it, so a
  missing Core makes the probe absent — which a host's setup stub reports honestly — rather than
  present and nil-erroring mid-run.
- `PerfPanel minor 2` takes its backdrop from `Core.SKIN` instead of a private lookalike, and draws
  Core's close button when the host supplies no `decorate`. `decorate` itself is unchanged and still
  takes precedence; the contract is additive-only.
- Initial extraction from AbsorbTracker (issue
  [#17](https://github.com/tusharsaxena/AbsorbTracker/issues/17)) — the probe, the record schema, the
  guided run, and the step panel, as `LibStub("LibKa0s-Perf-1.0")`.
- Still minor 1: the whole-branch review's fixes fold into the initial extraction rather than
  following it, since nothing has been released yet. A panel now re-attaches whenever the probe
  beneath it came from a different vendored copy; `:New()` reads `lib` rather than `self` throughout,
  so a LibStub minor upgrade cannot leave an instance reporting one schema while emitting another;
  `descriptor.buckets` entries are validated; `ring` is clamped to at least one record; panel labels
  re-resolve on every repaint; and a panel click prints exactly what typing the same command prints.
- `lib.MODULES` publishes the live minor of every file in the major, so version skew across vendored
  copies is answerable from in-game rather than by reading source.

### Documentation

- Documentation: the descriptor contract, the `suspend`/`resume` host contract, the public surface,
  and the record schema (v2) are written up in `README.md` and `docs/record-schema.md` (issue
  [#4](https://github.com/tusharsaxena/LibKa0s/issues/4)).
