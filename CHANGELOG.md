# Changelog

Two version numbers, and they are not the same thing. The repo carries a semver tag for humans. Each
**file** separately carries a LibStub **MINOR** integer that increments on every released change to
that file — that is what LibStub compares when it picks a winner between vendored copies, and a
released change that forgets its bump silently does not reach any host that already has the old copy.

Every release therefore opens with a version block naming each file's live minor. `tests/run.lua`
enforces that the block and `lib.MODULES` agree, so the two cannot drift. Release order is in
[docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md).

## Unreleased

Versions in this release: **Core minor 1**, **DebugLog minor 1**, **Perf minor 2**,
**PerfPanel minor 2**.

- New module `LibStub("LibKa0s-DebugLog-1.0")` — the on-screen debug console, which was the most
  duplicated thing in the collection: seven hand-transcribed copies of a window the standard already
  specifies down to the hex codes. `lib:New{ name, title, font, isEnabled, setEnabled, … }` returns
  an instance owning its own buffer and its own frames, with every frame global derived from `name`
  so two addons cannot collide on `UISpecialFrames`. The enable flag stays the host's: the library
  reads and writes it through the `isEnabled`/`setEnabled` pair rather than keeping a second copy
  that its slash command and its settings panel would disagree with. `initSummary` makes the
  `[Init]` line a host callback, which is what five of the sister addons already do.
- The buffer cap is now covered: no addon suite ever wrote 501 lines, so the eviction path had never
  run under test.

- New module `LibStub("LibKa0s-Core-1.0")` — the two seams every other module sits on. The
  secret-safe seam (`IsConcatSafe`, `SafeToString`, `SECRET`) carries AbsorbTracker's canonical
  `table.concat` probe, the only detector that fails on what a real combat-protected value actually
  fails on; the window chrome seam (`SKIN`, `ApplySkin`, `MakeCloseButton`) holds the backdrop and
  the close × a host's windows share. `lib:New{ prefix, sep, sink }` returns the prefixed,
  secret-safe chat printer, with `prefix` re-read on every call so a host whose tag constant loads
  later can pass a function instead of capturing nil forever.
- **Fixed:** a combat-protected value logged by a perf run rendered as its raw self, then raised
  inside the host's `table.concat(buffer, "\n")` when the user pressed Copy — killing the Copy
  button for the rest of the session. `Perf minor 2` deletes the private stringifier that caused it
  (it branched on `type()`, and a secret *is* a string or a number) in favour of
  `Core.SafeToString`. Perf now declares a minimum Core and refuses to register below it, so a
  missing Core makes the probe absent — which a host's setup stub reports honestly — rather than
  present and nil-erroring mid-run.
- `PerfPanel minor 2` takes its backdrop from `Core.SKIN` instead of a private lookalike, and draws
  Core's close button when the host supplies no `decorate`. `decorate` itself is unchanged and still
  takes precedence; the contract is additive-only.
- Initial extraction from AbsorbTracker (issue
  [#17](https://github.com/tusharsaxena/AbsorbTracker/issues/17)) — the probe, the record schema, the
  guided run, and the step panel, as `LibStub("LibKa0s-Perf-1.0")`.
- Still minor 1: the whole-branch review's fixes fold into the initial extraction rather than
  following it, since nothing has been released yet. A panel now re-attaches whenever the probe
  beneath it came from a different vendored copy; `:New()` reads `lib` rather than `self` throughout,
  so a LibStub minor upgrade cannot leave an instance reporting one schema while emitting another;
  `descriptor.buckets` entries are validated; `ring` is clamped to at least one record; panel labels
  re-resolve on every repaint; and a panel click prints exactly what typing the same command prints.
- `lib.MODULES` publishes the live minor of every file in the major, so version skew across vendored
  copies is answerable from in-game rather than by reading source.
- Documentation: the descriptor contract, the `suspend`/`resume` host contract, the public surface,
  and the record schema (v2) are written up in `README.md` and `docs/record-schema.md` (issue
  [#4](https://github.com/tusharsaxena/LibKa0s/issues/4)).
